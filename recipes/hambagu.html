    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hambagu is the Japanese take on the Hamburg Steak, using ingredients and methods common to the culture while also emulating some western practices. The notable examples of this are the use of ketchup, red wine, and worcestershire in the creation of the sauce, which aren't traditionally Japanese.</p>
        <p>These steaks are effectively meatballs, made in large. They're tender and juicy, and the sauce has a bold taste which pairs well with their subtle flavours. They pair well with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Hambagu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 Onion</li>
            <li>1 Lbs Minced Beef/Pork Mixture (2:1 or 3:1)</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup of Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Milk</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp </li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Red Wine (during cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp Red Wine</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp Ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp Water</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince onion finely, sauté until tender and almost translucent then set into a bowl to cool. It's best to wait a little while for these, so you can do your ingredient prep in the meantime.</li>
            <li>Into a large bowl add the onions, minced meat, panko, milk, egg, salt, pepper, and the nutmeg. Mix thoroughly until it becomes sticky and strands begin to form.</li>
            <li>Divide into four portions, and form into firm balls by throwing from one hand into the other. This forces out any air pockets, so be vigorous.</li>
            <li>Flatten into an oval shape with a dip in the centre and let rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat, and add 1 Tbsp of neutral oil. Place your patties into the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook until browned on the bottom and then flip. Continue to cook until browned on both sides.</li>
            <li>Add the 3 Tbsp of red wine and cover the pan with a lid. Allow to steam for 5-7 minutes. You can test doneness by piercing one patty with a fork or skewer and seeing if the juice that comes out is clear.</li>
            <li>Set aside to rest while you prepare the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain the fat from the pan but don't clean it.</li>
            <li>Add butter, ketchup, worcestershire, red wine, and water.</li>
            <li>Stir on medium heat until the sauce had thickened and the pan is clear. Dragging a spatula or spoon through the sauce should leave a clear line behind it.</li>
            <li>Drizzle over your Hambagu.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>    
            <li>I generally prefer to double the sauce recipe because it's quite nice, and the amount listed here is really only enough to have it with the burger.</li>
