    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic Mac n' Cheese, made in a rather peculiar way. I learned of this cooking method somewhat recently and I've been putting it through it's paces, to great effect.</p>
        <p>Simple and delightful, just a good creamy macaroni in cheese sauce. Add whatever toppings you would like, just remember to lower the amount of macaroni if you're adding a lot of toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Macaroni</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>120-200g Macaroni, depending on preference</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Any toppings of choice, prepared in advance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50 g Processed Cheese Slices</li>
            <li>50 g Cheese of Choice (Cheddar, Mozzarella, etc.), grated</li>
            <li>100 ml Milk</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp Garlic Powder, or 1-2 Garlic Cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp Onion Powder, or 1/2 Shallot, finely minced</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper, any other spices of choice</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate any cheese you have if you need to.</li>
            <li>If using fresh garlic and shallots, sauté them with a little bit a butter until they become translucent and aromatic, set aside for later.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the macaroni into a large cooking pot (this is a one-pot recipe) and add twice the weight of macaroni in water, or enough to just about cover them. Add a generous pinch of salt, keeping in mind you will not be straining off any of it later.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, stir occasionally and allow to cook.</li>
            <li>Once the macaroni have swelled and there is very little water left in the pan, add the milk. Continue to stir until the milk is heated up and add the cheese slices, stirring constantly until they've fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down, add the grated cheese and your spices, and stir until the sauce has combined. If the sauce becomes too thick, add more milk or water.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook like this until the macaroni reaches your desired doneness, taste for salt and seasoning and adjust as needed. Add any toppings, and plate directly from the pot.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>    
            <li>The cooking method is not a usual one for pasta, but is a mix between the typical large pot boil and an italian style of cooking pasta in sauce. It shortens cooking times and limits the amount of used cookware. Just pay attention to the heat and don't let the pan dry out while you aren't looking, otherwise the pasta will stick. Add more water as needed, if it's boiling off too fast, keeping in mind that the pasta should absorb most of it as well.</li>
        </ul>
