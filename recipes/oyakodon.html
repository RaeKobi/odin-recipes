    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oyakodon is a Japanese rice bowl dish, composed of the two main ingredients: chicken and egg. 'Oyako' means parent and child in Japanese, referring here to both those ingredients in what I consider exactly my kind of humour. 'Don' is short for 'donburi', meaning rice bowl.</p>
        <p>Made with onions and a teriyaki-style sauce, it's a dish both sweet, salty, and savoury. With chicken thighs and the benefit of Britain's world-class eggs, you get a very tender and rich meal with a filling bowl of rice to soak up the sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Oyakodon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 Onion</li>
            <li>150g Chicken Thighs, Boneless and Skinless</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Sake</li>
            <li>2 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1 Serving of Cooked Rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>60 ml Dashi</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Mirin</li>
            <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sauce ingredients together and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Slice the onion into large strips.</li>
            <li>Trim the fat from the chicken thighs, cut into diagonal strips and mix in a bowl with 1 Tbsp sake, let rest 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and use chopsticks to break the whites while leaving the yolks whole, once they are well broken, poke the yolks to break them but don't mix.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the onions and sauce to a cold pan, set to medium heat and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Once simmering, add the chicken and cook until the chicken is done.</li>
            <li>Add the egg mixture into the centre of the pan, trying to get mostly the whites.</li>
            <li>When the whites are set but not dry, add the rest of the eggs to the pan.</li>
            <li>Let sit a few moments, then slide the contents of the pan onto a bowl of rice.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>    
            <li>You can adjust the quantity of soy sauce depending on whether your rice is salted or not. I tend to add a little more, since I prefer my food well salted.</li>
